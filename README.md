# Software Portability and Optimization (SPO600)

This repository contains lab work and projects for the Software Portability and Optimization course, focusing on cross-platform development, assembly language programming, compiler optimization, and performance analysis.

## Course Overview

The Software Portability and Optimization course introduces students to the challenges of:
- Porting software to run on new architectures
- Optimizing software for better performance
- Understanding low-level system architecture differences
- Benchmarking and profiling techniques

## Repository Structure

### Labs

#### Lab 1: 6502 Assembly Programming Fundamentals
- Bitmap graphics programming on the 6502 emulator
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Simple graphics experiments

#### Lab 2: 6502 Math and Subroutines
- Implementation of a bouncing graphic demonstration
- Programming with image drawing subroutines

#### Lab 3: BCD Subtraction Calculator
- A 6502 Assembly calculator implementation
- Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) number representation and operations

#### Lab 4: Building GCC from Source
- Cross-platform compiler construction
- Performance comparison between x86 and ARM architectures
- Incremental compilation analysis

#### Lab 5: ARM64 and x86 Assembly Comparison
- Loop implementations in ARM64 and x86_64 assembly
- Number formatting and printing in assembly
- Times tables calculator implementation

### Projects

#### Project 1: Custom GCC Pass Implementation
- Creation of a custom compiler pass for GCC
- Counting basic blocks and GIMPLE statements in functions

#### Project 2: Function Clone Detection and Analysis
- Enhanced GCC pass development
- Analysis of function clones for optimization
- Determining when functions can be pruned

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- 6502 Emulator (http://6502.cdot.systems) for Labs 1-3
- GCC development environment for Projects 1-2
- x86_64 and ARM64 development environments for Lab 4-5

### Running the Labs
Each lab directory contains necessary files and a README with specific instructions.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Identify differences between computer architectures
- Describe the process of porting software to new architectures
- Identify architecture-specific code segments
- Read and write assembly language code
- Benchmark and profile software performance
- Optimize software for better performance
- Use the tools of open source development (version control, build systems, etc.)
